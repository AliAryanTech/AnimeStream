## Introduction

This project is made to just test my skills (im still kind of new). While this is a work in progress, I'm excited to share my journey with you. Expect some hiccups along the way—I'm still learning! Making this app has taught me many things(mainly to cope with depression and rage). I will be making updates and fixing issues and bugs in my free time!
